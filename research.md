# Visual Research

## App Type
Tool/SaaS - Book collection management tool for book enthusiasts

## Pattern
**Gradient-Heavy** with soft shadows and friendly warmth

## Reasoning
Based on industry research:
- Library management systems in 2025 emphasize personalized user experience with adaptive dashboards
- Book tracking apps like Libib use visually appealing interfaces with distinct color schemes
- The app should feel warm and inviting (like a library), not cold/sterile
- Target audience (book enthusiasts) responds well to friendly, engaging visuals

## Visual Style
- **Cards**: Gradient backgrounds (from-primary/20 to-accent/10) with soft shadows
- **Buttons**: Gradient treatments (bg-gradient-to-r from-primary to-accent)
- **Depth**: Elevated cards with soft shadows (shadow-lg)
- **Corners**: Rounded (0.75rem) for friendly, approachable feel
- **Colors**: Warm palette dominates (primary blue #4A90E2, accent coral/red #FF5A5F)

## Animation Approach
- Subtle hover effects on cards (scale, shadow increase)
- Smooth transitions for state changes
- Gentle animations for scanning/adding books

## Color Treatment
- Gradient overlays on stat cards
- Soft gradient backgrounds on hero sections
- Colored shadows matching brand colors
- Transparent gradient overlays on images
